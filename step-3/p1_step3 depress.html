  <p><strong style="font-size:36pt;">People used to carefully read my posts</strong><br> and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. <br>Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.

    The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, <br>but smartphones were still mostly used to

    <br><br><p style="font-family:Herculanum"><strong style="font-size:25px;">make phone calls, send short messages, handle emails, surf the web</strong></p><br><br>

    There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. <br>There was <strong>no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp</strong>.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="c">
  <p>
    Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were BLOGS: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis. <p style="color:red">They were my life.</p>

<div class="d">
  <p>
    <div style="font-family:Herculanum">It had all started with <em>9/11</em>.
    </div>
      <br><div style="border-left:solid 2px grey;padding-left:5px;">I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.
      <br>We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.
      <br>I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs.
      <br>Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.
      <br>So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting.
      <br>Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger's publishing platform before Google bought it.

  </p>
  <p>
    <div style="font-family:Herculanum">Then, on <em>November 5, 2001</em>,</div> <br><div style="border-left:solid 2px grey;padding-left:5px;">I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. <br>That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: <br>Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, <br>and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
