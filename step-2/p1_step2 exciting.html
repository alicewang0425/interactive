  <p><strong style="font-size:50pt;">People</strong> used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, <br/>and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. <br>Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.

    <br><br>There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. <br>There was <strong>no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp</strong>.

    Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were BLOGS: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis.

    It had all started with <em>9/11</em>. <br><div style="border-bottom:solid 3px pink;padding-left:5px;padding-bottom: 20px;">I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. <br>I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, <br>and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, <br>using Blogger's publishing platform before Google bought it.</div>

  <p>
    Then, on <em>November 5, 2001</em>, <br><div style="border-bottom:solid 3px pink;padding-left:5px;">I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands <br>of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
