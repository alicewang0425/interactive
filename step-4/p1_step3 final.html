  <div class="coolStuff">
    <p>
      People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, <br/>and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. <br>Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.

    The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, <br>but smartphones were still mostly used to<br><br>
    make phone calls, send short messages, handle emails, surf the web
    <br><br>There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. <br>There was <strong>no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="c">
  <p>
    Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were BLOGS: <br>the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis.
    <p style="color:red">They were my life.<br><br></p>

    It had all started with <em>9/11</em>. <br><div style="border-bottom:dotted 2px grey;padding:5px;">I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. <br>We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. <br>I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. <br>Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. <br>So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. <br>Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger's publishing platform before Google bought it.</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, on <em>November 5, 2001</em>, <br><div style="border-bottom:dotted 2px grey;padding-left:5px;">I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. <br>That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: <br>Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, <br>and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
